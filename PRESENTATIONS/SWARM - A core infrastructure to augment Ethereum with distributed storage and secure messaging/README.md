## Tim Bansemer, Aron Fischer: SWARM - A core infrastructure to augment Ethereum with distributed storage and secure messaging

- SWARM WHY - Why a blockchain alone is not enough?
- VISION: "A free and sovereign digital society through an internet without servers or gatekeepers."
- MISSION "Storage and communication infrastructure for a sovereign digital society."
- TEAM & ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE - Overview of the new team-structure and members as well as the different tracks and working groups.
- PARTNER - How Swarm is working with strategic partners and the community to fullfill its mission.
- DEVELOPMENT STATUS - Where do we stand with the delivery of SWARM 1.0?
- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ( Our MVP's) - How do we develop and how can you engage?
- TRY IT -> LINK to the HOW TO to start building and prototyping on Swarm

Additional Information:
Swarm has gone through a restructuring process of the organisation and its focus and revived traction on the development and partnerships. In this talk We'll give an update on the status of the team and the project overall as we are focused on the first incentivised testnetwork of Swarm.

### About Tim
Tim Bansemer is driven by the commitment for systemic change to help to manage the challenges of our time. Therefore he supports the creation of a sovereign digital society and new forms of direct participatory governance. He drives and supports multiple projects which are aligned with this goal.

For revision.io he acts as a circle founder for "The future of Governance / Distributed Governance" and gatheres brilliant thinkers to allow for the creation of a new generation of holistic governance models.

### About Aron
Aron Fischer received his PhD in Mathematics in 2015 before turning full-time to working on Ethereum and related technologies. He coauthored the Colony Whitepaper, was one of the very first test users of the ENS on Ropsten, and he has been working on Swarm as a researcher ever since Devcon 1.
Aron is motivated by the social dimension of Ethereum and the web3.0, the vision of democratic control over out digital commons, a serverless internet open to all. Swarm fits squarely into that vision - building the infrastructure necessary for a truly sovereign digital civil society.
