## Vojtech Simetka, Rinke Hendriksen: Distributed storage meets incentivization on Swarm
Swarm is a decentralised storage platform and content distribution network, a native base layer service of the Ethereum web3 stack. Such a network can only be sufficiently decentralized and robust when a proper economic incentive for nodes to participate in a constructive way is in place. This incentive layer (SW3) has always been part of the roadmap.
We are proud to announce that this vision is now becoming a reality! During this lightning talk, we will launch the base layer of the Swarm network's incentive system. From now on, it is possible for anyone to participate in the Swarm network, and be rewarded for providing valuable service to other users who use Swarm to store and retrieve their files. 

### About Rinke
Rinke Hendriksen is a smart-contract developer and crypto-economist and, being part of the Swarm incentive track, he has contributed to making incentives on Swarm reality. Rinke has a background in economics and Finance, with a Bachelor of Science in Economy and all exams passed to call himself a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst. Nevertheless, he decided not to follow the conventional path and choose to pursue a career in Blockchain instead. After following the MSc in Digital Currencies at the University of Nicosia and spending many spare hours to become up to speed with (smart-contract) development he now contributes full force to make the blockchain vision a success.
