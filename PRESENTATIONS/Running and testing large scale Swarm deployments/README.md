## Anton Evangelatov, Rafael Matias: Running and testing large scale Swarm deployments
In this talk we will demo some of the tools we use to build and test Swarm, namely:

- our cluster environment, built using Kubernetes, on which we run private Swarm networks for testing purposes, simulations and development
- our tracing system, built using OpenTracing and Jaeger
- our metrics system, built using InfluxDB and Grafana

We will run a few examples and show how you can use the tools if you want to build on top of Swarm or if you want to help improve Swarm
