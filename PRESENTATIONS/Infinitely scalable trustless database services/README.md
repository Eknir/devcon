## Viktor Tron: Infinitely scalable trustless database services

Proximity order trie or POT is a container data structure ideally suited for persistent distributed databases. Previous work showed that any functional pointer based data structure can be made swarm native, with data nodes as chunks and pointer references corresponding to content addresses. Data structure algorithms can be interpreted as peer to peer network protocols. Secured by merkle proofs this allows infinitely scalable trustless database services. This talk demonstrates this using POT and details the benefits in the context of potential applications like pss mailbox We also give real world applications such as chat history, status updates, blockchains, transaction history or generic ontologies.
