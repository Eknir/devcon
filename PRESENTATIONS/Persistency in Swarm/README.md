## Persistency in Swarm

The presentation is about persisting different types of data in our decentralized network of untrusted nodes in the face of churn, spam and actively malicious nodes. From the point of view of persistency, data can be very different ranging from popular content such as the static assets of popular Dapps to content that is extremely rarely accessed such as encrypted backups. Both the challenges and their solutions are discussed, with more emphasis on incentives and their (mis-)alignment.
