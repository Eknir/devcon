# Swarm for Node Operators - Run an incentivised Swarm node.
The Devcon Incentives workshop has the goal to introduce participants playfully to the world of SWAP. To that end, we will start with a small demonstration where we shortly present SWAP and show the workings thereof. Subsequently, we will instruct participants to open their laptops and navigate to a GitHub page where they will find the handout of the workshop. The handout describes how participants download, install and run a swap-enabled node. Participants are asked to fulfill tasks and upon completion of a task they qualify for earning a sticker. Tasks are:

**Basis**: everybody should be able to fulfill these tasks during the workshop
- Deploy a chequebook
- Receive a cheque
- Sent a cheque
- Cash a cheque
- Have a cheque been cashed

**Extra**: for those who are finished earlier and want something extra
- Connect to a different Ethereum network (_not_ mainnet)
- Connect to a different, but already existing chequebook
- Have a cheque been cashed by another person and compensate him/her for the gas-costs (tip: you can not do this yet via Swarm)

The handout should guide the participants in getting all stickers, but we do encourage participants to try and reach the goals without referring to the handout
