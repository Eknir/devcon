## About the workshop
In this workshop we will playfully introduce you to setting up up and operating an incentivised Swarm node - marking the first ever live test of an  incentivised Swarm Network. The workshop will cover installation and setup, security best practices, a UI demonstration & a walkthrough. This represents joint work of the Swarm Team and IOV Labs.
